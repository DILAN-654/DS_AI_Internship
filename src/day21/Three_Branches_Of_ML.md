# Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is broadly divided into three main branches:

-   Supervised Learning
-   Unsupervised Learning
-   Reinforcement Learning

Each branch differs based on how data is provided and how learning
happens.

## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning uses labeled datasets, where each input has a known
correct output.\
The model learns relationships between features and targets to predict
outcomes for new data.\
It is mainly applied to classification and regression problems.

### Examples

-   Spam Email Detection\
-   House Price Prediction\
-   Student Performance Prediction\
-   Disease Diagnosis

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning works with unlabeled data, meaning no predefined
answers exist.\
The algorithm discovers hidden structures, similarities, or clusters
automatically.\
It is commonly used for pattern discovery and data exploration.

### Examples

-   Customer Segmentation\
-   Market Basket Analysis\
-   Fraud Detection\
-   News Article Grouping

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning trains an agent through interaction with an
environment using rewards and penalties.\
The system learns optimal actions via trial and error to maximize
cumulative rewards.\
It is suitable for decision-making and sequential learning problems.

### Examples

-   Self-Driving Cars\
-   Game Playing AI (Chess/Go)\
-   Robot Navigation\
-   Recommendation Optimization Systems

## Why This Matters

Choosing the correct learning paradigm is the first step in Machine
Learning.\
A wrong selection leads to poor model performance even before coding
begins.

    "Machine Learning is a way of building computer systems that can learn patterns from data instead of being programmed with fixed instructions. In traditional programming, we provide the computer with rules and input data to get results, but in machine learning we give the system data along with expected outputs, and it automatically learns the rules needed to make predictions on new data. There are different types of machine learning based on how the system learns. In Supervised Learning, the model learns from labeled data, such as predicting house prices based on past price data or detecting spam emails using examples marked as spam or not spam. In Unsupervised Learning, the model finds patterns in data without labels, like grouping customers into different segments based on their shopping behavior. In Reinforcement Learning, the system learns by trial and error using rewards and penalties, such as a robot learning to walk or an AI learning to play games by improving its performance over time."
